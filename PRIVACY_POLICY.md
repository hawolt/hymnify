# Privacy Policy for Hymnify Extension

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which the Hymnify Extension collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the Hymnify Extension.

## Personal Identification Information

I may collect a unique installation identifier ("ID") generated upon the installation of my Extension. This ID is used solely to identify individual installations and is not linked to any personally identifiable information. Users do not need to provide any personal information to use my Extension.

## Data Collection and Usage

Upon installation, my Extension may collect and transmit a "link" to my servers. This link is submitted by the User and may contain information about the content they are interacting with within their Browser. This data is solely used to enable functionality within the Extension and is not shared with any third parties.

## Data Security

I take the security of User data seriously. All collected data, including the installation ID and submitted links, are securely stored on my server. I implement appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the server.

## Data Retention

While uninstalling the Extension does not automatically delete data from my server, the association between the installation ID and any associated data is reset when the User reinstalls the Extension. This means that upon reinstallation, the User will receive a new installation ID, effectively dissociating any previous data collected.

## Data Sharing

I do not share any collected data with third parties. The collected data is solely used for the purpose of providing functionality within the Extension and is not shared, sold, or otherwise distributed to any external parties.

## User Control and Access

Users have full control over the data collected by my Extension. They can choose to uninstall the Extension at any time, which will reset the association between their installation ID and any previous data collected. Additionally, Users can request to delete their data by contacting me at hymnify@hawolt.com.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I have the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time. When I do, I will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. I encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how I am protecting their data. Your continued use of the Extension following the posting of changes to this policy will be deemed your acceptance of those changes.

## Contacting Me

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the practices of my Extension, please contact me at hymnify@hawolt.com.
